  abstract = {We consider a class of continuous-time cooperative systems evolving on the positive orthant R + n . We show that if the origin is globally attractive, then it is also globally stable and, furthermore, there exists an unbounded invariant manifold where trajectories strictly decay. This leads to a small-gain-type condition which is sufficient for global asymptotic stability (GAS) of the origin.

We establish the following connection to large-scale interconnections of (integral) input-to-state stable (ISS) subsystems: If the cooperative system is (integral) ISS, and arises as a comparison system associated with a large-scale interconnection of (i)ISS systems, then the composite nominal system is also (i)ISS. We provide a criterion in terms of a Lyapunov function for (integral) input-to-state stability of the comparison system. Furthermore, we show that if a small-gain condition holds then the classes of systems participating in the large-scale interconnection are restricted in the sense that certain iISS systems cannot occur. Moreover, this small-gain condition is essentially the same as the one obtained previously by Dashkovskiy, R{\"u}ffer, and Wirth (2007, in~press) for large-scale interconnections of ISS systems.},

Under a small gain assumption on the monotone operator induced by the gain matrix, a locally Lipschitz continuous ISS Lyapunov function is obtained constructively for the entire network by appropriately scaling the individual Lyapunov functions for the subsystems.

This class of systems admits separable Lyapunov functions that are either the sum or the maximum of a collection of functions of a single argument. In either case, two classes of separable Lyapunov functions exist: the first class is separable along the system's state, and the second class is separable along components of the system's vector field. The latter case is advantageous for many practically motivated systems for which it is difficult to measure the system's state but easier to measure the system's velocity or rate of change.

For Industrie 4.0 to come true, it is essential to implement the horizontal integration of inter-corporation value network, the end-to-end integration of engineering value chain, and the vertical integration of factory inside. In this paper, we focus on the vertical integration to implement flexible and reconfigurable smart factory. We first propose a brief framework that incorporates industrial wireless networks, cloud, and fixed or mobile terminals with smart artifacts such as machines, products, and conveyors. Then, we elaborate the operational mechanism from the perspective of control engineering, that is, the smart artifacts form a self-organized system which is assisted with the feedback and coordination blocks that are implemented on the cloud and based on the big data analytics. In addition, we outline the main technical features and beneficial outcomes and present a detailed design scheme. We conclude that the smart factory of Industrie 4.0 is achievable by extensively applying the existing enabling technologies while actively coping with the technical challenges.},

We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum-norm problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under feedback. These results are developed in a very general framework, and are shown to hold in both continuous and discrete time, for both stable and unstable systems, and for any norm. This notion unifies many previous results identifying specific tractable decentralized control problems, and delineates the largest known class of convex problems in decentralized control. As an example, we show that optimal stabilizing controllers may be efficiently computed in the case where distributed controllers can communicate faster than their dynamics propagate. We also show that symmetric synthesis is included in this classification, and provide a test for sparsity constraints to be quadratically invariant, and thus amenable to convex synthesis.},

  abstract = {Significant progress has been made on nonlinear control systems in the past two decades. However, many of the existing nonlinear control methods cannot be readily used to cope with communication and networking issues without nontrivial modifications. For example, small quantization errors may cause the performance of a "well-designed" nonlinear control system to deteriorate.  Motivated by the need for new tools to solve complex problems resulting from smart power grids, biological processes, distributed computing networks, transportation networks, robotic systems, and other cutting-edge control applications, Nonlinear Control of Dynamic Networks tackles newly arising theoretical and real-world challenges for stability analysis and control design, including nonlinearity, dimensionality, uncertainty, and information constraints as well as behaviors stemming from quantization, data-sampling, and impulses. Delivering a systematic review of the nonlinear small-gain theorems, the text:   Supplies novel cyclic-small-gain theorems for large-scale nonlinear dynamic networks Offers a cyclic-small-gain framework for nonlinear control with static or dynamic quantization Contains a combination of cyclic-small-gain and set-valued map designs for robust control of nonlinear uncertain systems subject to sensor noise Presents a cyclic-small-gain result in directed graphs and distributed control of nonlinear multi-agent systems with fixed or dynamically changing topology  Based on the authors' recent research, Nonlinear Control of Dynamic Networks provides a unified framework for robust, quantized, and distributed control under information constraints. Suggesting avenues for further exploration, the book encourages readers to take into consideration more communication and networking issues in control designs to better handle the arising challenges.},

A reference-independent stability constraint is introduced using a sum-separable control contraction metric. The proposed control design approach is thereby independent of both reference trajectories and the economic cost functions and as such suitable for flexible manufacturing. We observe that self-interested distributed optimization with shared responsibility for stability results in the same general problem formulation as network utility maximization, and make use of the alternating direction method of multipliers to coordinate the optimization. The proposed approach is illustrated with an example of distributed control of a network with 120 nodes, each of which is a three-state nonlinear system.},

Each iteration of our algorithm requires one projection onto the positive semidefinite cone and the solution of multiple quadratic programs with closed-form solutions free of any matrix inversion. Our techniques are implemented in the open-source MATLAB solver SOSADMM. Numerical experiments on SOS problems arising from unconstrained polynomial minimization and from Lyapunov stability analysis for polynomial systems show speed-ups compared to the interior-point solver SeDuMi, and the first-order solver CDCS.},
