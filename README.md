# Algorithms used in the paper Distributed Nonlinear Control Design using Separable Control Contraction Metrics

Abstract. This paper gives convex conditions for synthesis of a distributed  control system control for a class of large-scale networked nonlinear dynamic systems.  It is shown that the technique of control contraction metrics (CCMs) can be extended to this problem by utilizing {\em separable} metric structures, resulting in controllers that only depend on information from local sensors and communications from immediate neighbours. The conditions given are pointwise linear matrix inequalities, and are necessary and sufficient for linear positive systems. Distributed synthesis methods based on chordal graphs are also proposed. A simple example demonstrates feasibility for network  of nonlinear dynamic systems with up to 512 nodes.
